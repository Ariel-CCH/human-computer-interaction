                  Yoga is not merely a form of exercise for the body. It is a pathway towards peacefulness that enhances self-awareness. 
                  The recent pandemic set a path to explore new online teaching and learning opportunities. 
                  An increasingly recognized approach that has great potential in improving remote learning is mobile augmented reality (MAR) apps. 
                  This project analyzes the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) in educational settings and evaluates how MAR can be applied to existing yoga apps. 
                  We came up with Y360, an AR yoga app that provides 360° video courses, enabling new immersive experiences for yoga practitioners. 
                  We also performed usability testing on Y360 to evaluate the effectiveness of our mobile application and improved on our product through the feedback and suggestions provided by users.

              <p id='1.1 problem_space_txt'>
                  Attending classes at yoga studios has become a trend as its environment helps with group healing and support. 
                  However, the recent pandemic has changed the way people learn yoga: the majority of people choose to practice yoga at home 
                  rather than attending classes physically. Challenges of learning yoga remotely arises with this transition and is exemplified 
                  in the absence of interaction and feedback between learners and instructors.  
                  This may lead to the lack of motivation to complete the workout and increases the risk of yoga-related injuries. 
                  Y360 aims to address these challenges by introducing an interactive learning environment and personalized training courses 
                  through employing action-recognition systems in MAR.

              <p>
                  In order to better understand our target users and address their pain points, we conducted semi-interviews with five students 
                  from National Taiwan University who have been practicing yoga consistently for more than a year. 
                  We focused on questions about their experiences, needs and expectations of yoga practices.
              <br><br> 
                  It is shown that yoga practitioners expect 
                  an engaging environment where they can interact with yoga instructors and their peers. Their main pain points include lack of customized learning and personal space. 
                  To address these user needs, we proposed 4 guidelines for our product design to create and enhance a learning environment for yoga practitioners by: 
                  <ul>
                      <li>providing sufficient and clear demonstrations and verbal instructions</li>
                      <li>giving real-time feedback and correcting errors</li>
                      <li>allowing users to create yoga sequences based on learners’ own preferences</li>
                      <li>creating a platform where learners are able to share their learning experiences</li>

                  <p>
                    Emily is a junior undergraduate student. She is a beginner in yoga and is dedicated to making yoga a habit. She attended yoga classes a few times but didn’t feel comfortable practicing with strangers around her. Besides, she lives 40-minutes away from the city center where the training center is located. Commuting between her home and the training center is time-consuming for her. She also has a tight schedule and having a heavy course load is stressful so she needs effective ways to relieve stress.

              <p>
                  Before diving into the design process, we conducted a competitive analysis to gain a better understanding of the market environment we are operating in. We looked into two types of competitive forces, including yoga apps and a virtual reality yoga game and identified two main areas that have the potential for improvements: personalized courses and a holistic view of yoga positions. First, some products only provide limited courses that restrict user choices. We aim to provide both pre-designed courses and customized courses for users to plan their workout. Moreover, most videos in yoga applications only offer side and front views of instructors demonstrating poses. We hope to integrate AR technology to create an immersive experience where users can explore yoga poses further through rotating and zooming 360° interactive videos. Finally, it is our focus to improve the real-time feedback system so that users can reflect on their performance and improve in the next classroom.

                <p>Boasts audio and visual instructions would guide users through poses step by step. Users can turn on their camera, using real-time visual feedback to learn and optimize poses by comparing their postures with the optimal position. We also provide audio feedback that corrects users movements. Instant feedback allows users to have interactive experiences like they do at a real-life studio and reduces the risk of injury caused by incorrect postures. By rotating the view of the instructor in the 360° videos, users are able to master their skills by studying our instructional library of poses and have a comprehensive view from multiple perspectives. </p>

For instance, they discovered features of selecting course levels, turned on audio instructions, and created personal training programs. One participant suggested a new sharing feature that allows users to share their yoga practicing videos on social media and connect their schedule to other calendar apps on their smartphones. 
                <br>
                <br>Some of the participants expressed reservations about online courses as they are not as rigorous as traditional face-to-face courses. One participant showed concerns about not having enough distance in their rooms to practice yoga which could negatively affect the use of the recording feature.

              <h2>Perliminary Evaluation</h2>
              <p>The results showed that while users discovered and enjoyed features of Y360, there are needs for more customized features and courses to make the app more user-friendly. A preliminary evaluation with points of improvements are put forward to enhance UX: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Feature Activation: 
                    <br>To address the problem of users not being able to discover features of the product, we recommend improving feature activation in ways of making on-boarding contextual, segmenting users personalized messaging, and announcing new features. 
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    A Multi-platform Connection: 
                    <br>To improve data integration, we suggest a multi-platform connection that enables users to merge their yoga schedule into their existing calendars and sync reminders on their digital devices. Building connections that help make the link between Y360 and social media effective is also a point of improvement. This includes expanding sharing options to offer an engaging community through Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, etc.
                  </p>
                  
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Alternative Yoga Poses: 
                    <br>Helping users overcome learning barriers is important as some yoga poses are too difficult to do. We suggest adding a bonus feature that offers modified poses for beginner yoga students in preparation for advanced poses. Besides, it is noted that some yoga poses are challenging in a small space. To address this, providing yoga posture alternatives when the space is limited will be helpful for users.
                    </p>
                  
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Advanced Audio Instructions: 
                    <br>As some of the participants looked for more rigorous training to achieve their personal goals, we recommend providing additional audio instructions that give more details on how to correct and improve positioning. Besides, it is also suggested that a list of recommended courses is provided at the end of every course to guide users on the video courses to watch next.

              <p id='conlusion_txt'>
                  In this p, we looked at the challenges of online yoga learning, such as the lack of social interaction and motivation, and highlighted the mental well-being of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created Y360, a yoga mobile application that integrates AR technology, providing an interactive and immersive learning environment. Y360 provides three core features: (1) a collection of 360° video courses; (2) an automatic detection and recognition of practitioner actions; and (3) audio instructions and real-time feedback. Our findings suggest that AR enhances remote learning as it facilitates human interactions. The combination of interactivity and engagement could enhance the ability of learners to remember what they’ve learned and offer new opportunities for interpersonal connections. High-quality UX in yoga apps is associated with personalized training and interactive audio instructions. Personalized training allows users to go in depth on specific poses and focus on personal goals, while interactive audio instructions are essential for recreating the intimacy of in-person classes and avoiding yoga-related injuries.

                  <br><br>However, our prototype has its own limitations. According to usability testing, it would be helpful to create additional features to make the mobile application more user-friendly. It will be important that the future work investigates ways to ensure a personalized and flexible experience for users, from on-boarding to choosing video courses to receiving feedback. Moreover, as we mainly focused on the user interface design of our prototype, there is room for improving the technical design, especially the integration of AR and mobile applications. We hope our work can inspire researchers and designers to create more effective tools to make AR in apps more inclusive. In particular, we encourage future work on designing and evaluating techniques that enable users to enjoy AR within a small physical space.
